# Simple-Delivery

**Product description**<br>
The Simply Delivered is a mailbox and an Android application combination used to notify online shoppers
that their awaiting deliveries have been delivered.

**Benefit proposition**<br>
As the global pandemic has left many people to stay home, online shopping has become an
activity that many have started to participate in. Unfortunately, some have found the perfect
opportunity to steal other people’s packages. This is where Simply Delivered comes in! When a
delivery has been delivered, a notification will be sent directly to their phone and they will be
able to lock their mailbox, to make sure that it won’t be stolen.

**Key business goal**<br>
The simply delivered mailbox with all the internal hardware components will be sold at $299,
yielding a $166.10 per unit sold gross margin. The hardware-dependent simply delivered app
will be free to register and use. The development team will spend 500 hours developing the
android mobile application and assembling together the internal components of the mailbox
hardware at $40 per hour or $20,000. The team would need to sell 121 units of the mailbox to
break even. Not only is this product the first of its kind, the retail price of our product undercuts
the prices of mailboxes in the market that have no sensor features by $157. The increase in
online shopping from the 2020 pandemic further justifies the demand and the profitability of
simply delivered.

**Target market**<br>
The target market for this product is anyone that participates in online shopping more
specifically, for our first prototype, for those who live in single family homes.

**Assumptions**<br>
First, our product does not guarantee that the user's deliveries will not be stolen. It, however,
serves as a first step towards that.

Second, the locking system is completely controlled by the user. In the case that a delivery is
made earlier than expected, that will be up to the delivery person. As well as if the user receives
more than one parcel the same day, it is in his decision to lock or not the mailbox. However,
Simply Delivered will make sure that the user will be notified whenever there is a delivery made,
regardless if the user’s application is on or not.

Third, will make sure that the locking system is properly implemented such that it is not of a
worry to the users.

**Constraints**<br>
Constraints 1: The sensor needs to have an accurate detection, otherwise, the notification sent
to the users will be misleading.
Constraints 2: The suggestions form the application may not meet the expectation of the user.
Constraints 3: The professional information from the product may not be understandable to the
users.

**Stakeholders**<br>
The stakeholders for the Simply Delivered product are delivery companies, whoever participates
in online shopping and hopefully in the future, e-commerce websites.

- Delivery Companies:
The delivery companies will be benefited as they won’t have to worry to notify the users
of their delivery arrival.

- Online shoppers:
Those who participate in online shopping will benefit from not getting their delivery stolen
and keep track of their receiving orders in the app.

- E-commerce websites
In the future, e-commerce websites can benefit from working in collaboration with the simply
delivered to notify the users of their delivery arrival in a safe manner with our mailbox.
